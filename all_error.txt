1.after geting the response from get in the axios then it must be assign to the const data=response.data
2.app.use(express.json())=> it is used to use the post oparations. it need to be inizialisee in the before the post operation
3.here the  app.use(express.json()) here in the json need to be called in function  json()
4.here the in the axios the (req,res) will not work because it is aepress instead the (response) only work in the axios.
5. in map if to change the value then return statement must be given
6. user.find((u)=>{return u.username==username})  if the {} are given then return statement must be given
7.key pair must be give in json file incase of geting the element in the object   res.json({username: newtoken.username})
8.http://localhost:3000/signup here http: is need to be give it is a mantadory.
9.res.json({message: "Login successful",token: token  // ✅ include token in response}); here if we not include the token in the res than in the frontend it can't be used. so throught the res only the frond end can be used.
10.in the middle the res(json{ message}) should not used if it used than the reset of the code will not work.You should not send a response like res.json({ message: "successful login" }) inside the middleware — that's the job of the route handler (/me), not the middleware.
11.in the frontend res.json({username,password}) will not be work because in the previous the axois itself return the response so it can't be res further. res.json will not work .  res.json(...) as if you're working with a server response object, but res is already the response returned by axios, and axios responses don’t have a .json() method like fetch() responses.
12.while hashing throught the bcrypt password must be a string if it is a number than the null value will be return 
13.user.push({username,hashedpassword})if i change the hashedpasswordin the push condition than you only need to get the password from the hashedpassword so use this password:hashedpassword
14.et exist_user=user.find((u)=>{return u.username==username}) in here it return the uername only but we can access the that username all information like exist_user.password also can be accessed.
15.if i studown the ubunto by wsl //shutdown comment the ubuntu does not work because it need to be restarted so retart the whole system itself.
16.if the local system file is unable to delete than go to the ubunto and use rm -rf <file or foldername>
